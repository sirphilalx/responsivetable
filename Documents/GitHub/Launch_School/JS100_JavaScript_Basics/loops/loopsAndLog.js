//Add some code inside of the for loop below that logs the current value of i to the console on each iteration. Before you run the code: What sequence of numbers do you expect to be logged?

// the sequence should be counting in 2's

for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2) {
  // include your code here

	console.log(i);
}
