// Let's generalize the function from the previous exercise a bit. Implement a function cite that takes two string arguments: the author of the quote and what they said. It then logs the quote to the console, as in the following example.

let cite = (x, y) => {
	console.log(`${x} said, ${y}`);
}


cite('Brendan Eich', 'Always bet on JavaScript.');
